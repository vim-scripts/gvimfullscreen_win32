gVimWin32FullScreen
                                     Derek McLoughlin

* What is this
  Put gvim into full screen on the primary monitor in Microsoft Windows.
  This is a copy of Yasuhiro Matsumoto's VimTweak's EnableMaximize
  functionality	modified to deal with window borders and making the
  window overlap the task bar.

  Note: this only works on the primary monitor. I'll add other monitor support
  later.

* Compiling
  Compile the DLL using any version of Visual C++ for Windows
  Use the makefile - nmake
  copy gvimfullscreen.dll to the directory that has gvim.exe

* Usage
    Toggle
    :call libcallnr("gvimfullscreen.dll", "ToggleFullScreen", 0)

	For  example:
	map <F11> <Esc>:call libcallnr("gvimfullscreen.dll", "ToggleFullScreen", 0)<CR>
